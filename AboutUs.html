                <h3>Operations & Culture</h3><br>
                 <p>
                      Briteweb is a pioneer in the future of work, company culture and 21st century organizational strategy. Our team members are tech-enabled, incredibly well connected and led by a world-class project management and administrative team. We work tirelessly to continually 
                      improve our processes and the quality of the work we deliver. We consider every challenge to be a learning opportunity and encourage an open and safe environment for everyone on the team to provide ideas and feedback.

                       We understand that creativity and talent alone aren’t enough when the world’s biggest issues are on the line. Working in the social sector means higher stakes, more complexity and heightened investment from everyone involved. And we’re experts at designing and guiding processes to suit these environments. Our clients appreciate the transparency, budget clarity and peace of mind we offer, even when there may be many unknowns.

                       </p><br>
				
                 <h3>Our Values</h3><br>
                 <p>
					Briteweb is built on a foundation of strong values, mission and purpose. They guide our hiring process and our approach to ensuring the right fit with the clients we engage with. Our values are more than words on a page for us, they are built into everything we do.

				<h3>We’re in it together.</h3><br>
				<p>
				 Our best work is created when we collaborate. This means social equality between staff members as well as our client teams. We don’t play the blame game, instead, we create a safe environment to share challenges and support one another to find solutions.
				</p>

				<h3>We’re open-hearted.</h3><br>
					<p>Real people, real feelings. In our careers, we’re going to spend a huge amount of time with our colleagues and clients. Teams are happier and more productive when we get to know and care for one another in a meaningful way.
				</p><br>

				<h3>We’re resourceful.</h3><br>
					<p>We are nimble, entrepreneurial and prepared for the unexpected. The world is changing at the rate of technology and we need to be open and prepared to solve new problems every day.
				</p><br>
				<h3>We’re accountable.</h3><br>
				<p>
					Trust with clients and each other is critical to our success. We do what we say we’re going to do, and when that’s not possible, we communicate clearly with everyone involved to redefine expectations. Communicating early and often, even when it’s not good news, is critical in our fast paced, team-based environment.
